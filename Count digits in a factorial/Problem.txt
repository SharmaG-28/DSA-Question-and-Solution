Count digits in a factorial

Given an integer N.
You have to find the number of digits that appear in its factorial,
where factorial is defined as,
factorial(N) = 1*2*3*4..*N and factorial(0) = 1.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Output:
3
Explanation:
5! is 120 so there are 3
digits in 120

Example 2:

Input:
N = 10
Output:
7
Explanation:
10! is 3628800 so there are
7 digits in 3628800


Expected Time Complexity: O(Log(N))
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 104
