# Binary Tree Postorder Traversal

Given the root of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

# Example 1:
Tnput :
Enter the number of nodes in the binary tree: 6
Enter value of node 1: 1
Enter value of node 2: 2
Enter value of node 3: 3
Enter value of node 4: 4
Enter value of node 5: 5
Enter value of node 6: 6
Enter the parent-child relationships (as pairs of node indices).
Enter parent index and child index separated by space: 0 1
Enter parent index and child index separated by space: 0 2
Enter parent index and child index separated by space: 1 3
Enter parent index and child index separated by space: 1 4
Enter parent index and child index separated by space: 2 5

Postorder Traversal: [4, 5, 2, 3, 1]
 
# Constraints:
The number of the nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].  
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
